2. Adding an Index Page

When a user visits the home page, they should see a list of the documents in the CMS: history.txt, changes.txt and about.txt:

Implementation:
  use `Dir.each` to render each file name in a list
  
3. Viewing Text Files

 - text files on homepage are links
 - path is `/filename`

  - path = /:filename
  - pass filename as param
- define route get `/:filename`
  - load the contents of file
  - link to erb file page
- creat file.erb
  - display text
